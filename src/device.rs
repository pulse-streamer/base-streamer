//! Implements struct and methods corresponding to NI devices. See [`BaseDevice`] for
//! implementation details.
//!
//! A NI control system consists of one or both of the components:
//! 1. Devices (cards) directly attached the computer via PCIe/USB.
//! 2. A PCIe link card connected to a PXIe chassis, which hosts multiple PXIe cards.
//!
//! ## Device
//! In this library, every [`Device`] object corresponds to a particular task for
//! a physical device (e.g. analogue output for `PXI1Slot1`). A `Device` trivially implements the
//! [`BaseDevice`] trait by supplying field methods.
//!
//! [`Device`] fields keep tracks of of the physical channels associated with the device
//! as well as device-wide data such as device name, trigger line, and synchronization behavior.
//!
//! The [`Device`] struct is the primary structure used to interact with NI hardware. It groups multiple
//! channels, each of which corresponds to a physical channel on an NI device. This struct provides
//! easy access to various properties of the device, such as its physical name, task type, and
//! several clock and trigger configurations.
//! For editing and compiling behavior of devices, see the [`BaseDevice`] trait.
//!
//!
//! ### Editable and streamable channels in devices
//! Library users create and edit editable channels. During compilation, based on the device's task type,
//! the library may internally add streamable channels.
//! For more details on editable and streamable channels, see the editable v.s. streamable section in
//! [`channel` module].
//!
//! ### Synchronization methods for devices
//! Each device's synchronization behavior is specified by its constructor arguments.
//! Refer to the [`Device`] struct for a more detailed explanation.

/// The `BaseDevice` trait defines the fundamental operations and attributes of a National Instruments (NI) device.
///
/// This trait abstracts the common functionalities that an NI device should possess, regardless of its specific hardware details or task type. Implementers of this trait will have access to core functionalities like channel management, device status checks, signal compilation, and more.
///
/// ## Typical Use
///
/// A type implementing `BaseDevice` is primarily used to interact with the associated NI hardware, manage its channels, and perform operations like signal generation, editing, and compilation.
///
/// # Trait Methods and Their Functionality:
///
/// - **Field methods**: These provide direct access to the properties of a device, such as its channels, physical name,
/// sampling rate, and various configuration parameters.
///
/// - **Synchronization configuration**: Customize the synchronization behavior of devices via [`BaseDevice::cfg_trig`],
/// [`BaseDevice::cfg_ref_clk`], [`BaseDevice::cfg_samp_clk_src`]. See [`Device`] for more details.
///
/// - **Channel management**: Methods like [`BaseDevice::editable_channels`], [`BaseDevice::editable_channels_`], and
/// [`BaseDevice::add_channel`] allow for the retrieval and manipulation of channels associated with the device.
///
/// - **Device status checks**: Methods like [`BaseDevice::is_compiled`], [`BaseDevice::is_edited`], and
/// [`BaseDevice::is_fresh_compiled`] enable checking the compilation and editing status of the device's channels.
///
/// - **Cache operations**: The methods [`BaseDevice::clear_edit_cache`] and [`BaseDevice::clear_compile_cache`] are
/// used to clear the edit and compile caches of the device's channels, respectively.
///
/// - **Compilation**: The [`BaseDevice::compile`] method takes care of the signal compilation process for the device's
/// channels. For Digital Output (DO) channels, it provides additional functionality to merge line channels into port channels.
///
/// - **Signal generation**: The [`BaseDevice::fill_signal_nsamps`] and [`BaseDevice::calc_signal_nsamps`] methods are
/// central to signal generation, allowing for the sampling of float-point values from compiled instructions based on
/// various criteria.
///
/// - **Utility functions**: Methods like [`BaseDevice::unique_port_numbers`] offer utility functionalities specific to certain
/// task types, aiding in operations like identifying unique ports in Digital Output (DO) devices.
///
///
/// # Implementing [`BaseDevice`]:
///
/// When creating a new type that represents an NI device, implementing this trait ensures that the type has all the necessary methods and behaviors typical of NI devices. Implementers can then extend or override these methods as necessary to provide device-specific behavior or optimizations.

/// easy access to various properties of the device, such as its physical name, task type, and
/// several clock and trigger configurations.
/// For editing and compiling behavior of devices, see the [`BaseDevice`] trait.
///
/// # Fields
/// - `channels`: A collection of channels associated with this device.
/// - `name`: Name of the device as seen by the NI driver.
/// - `task_type`: Specifies the task type associated with the device.
/// - `samp_rate`: The sampling rate of the device in Hz.
/// - `samp_clk_src`: Optional source of the sampling clock; supply `None` for on-board clock source.
/// - `trig_line`: Optional identifier for the port through which to import/export the task start trigger.
///     Supply `None` for trivial triggering behavior.
/// - `export_trig`: Optional Boolean indicating if the device exports its start trigger. If `true`, the device
///     exports the start trigger of the NI-task associated with this device through `trig_line`. If `false` or `None`,
///     the device is set to import the start trigger. In case that any device in an experiment has nontrivial triggering behavior,
///     one and only one of the devices must have `export_trig` set to `true`.
/// - `ref_clk_line`: Optional source of the reference clock to phase-lock the device clock to.
/// - `export_ref_clk`: Optional indicator of whether to export the reference clock. If `true`, the device exports its
///     reference clock. If `false` or `None`, it imports the reference clock. Use `None` for trivial behavior.
/// - `ref_clk_rate`: Optional rate of the reference clock in Hz.
///
/// # Synchronization Methods
///
/// For experiments that do not require synchronization between devices, set all optional fields of `Device` to `None`.
/// However, for more accurate and cohesive experiments, we recommend at least implementing start-trigger synchronization.
///
/// ## Start-trigger Synchronization
///
/// Relevant fields: `trig_line`, `export_trig`.
///
/// Refer to the official [NI documentation on start-trigger synchronization](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/ni-daqmx/page/mxcncpts/syncstarttrigger.html).
///
/// This method designates one device to export its start trigger and others to import. When the experiment begins, tasks on
/// devices with `export_trig` set to `false` are set to wait for a digital edge trigger from the `trig_line` channel. The device with `export_trig` set to `true` exports its start trigger to `trig_line`.
///
/// **Note**: It's essential to physically connect the device that exports its trigger (where `export_trig` is `true`) to the corresponding lines on devices that import the trigger.
///
/// For PCIe devices, use a `PFI` label. For PXIe devices, use the label `PXI_Trig` followed by a number in the range 0-7.
/// This backend crate ensures task synchronization such that threads handling tasks set to import the trigger always start listening for triggers before the exporting task begins.
///
/// For PXIe devices linked to a chassis, ensure that you configure trigger bus routing using NI-MAX (on Windows) or the
/// NI Hardware Configuration Utilities (on Linux) when specifying backplane trigger lines. Detailed information can be
/// found [here](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/pxi-platform-services-help/page/trigger_routing_and_reservation.html).
///
/// It's important to note that after starting, each device's task utilizes its internal clock, which may result in incremental
/// drifts between devices over time. For longer signals, it's advisable to use additional synchronization methods to ensure
/// clock alignment.
///
/// ### Example:
/// Here, the device `PXI1Slot6` exports its start trigger to `PXI1_Trig0`, while `PXI1Slot7` imports its start
/// trigger from the same line.
/// ```
/// # use nicompiler_backend::*;
/// let mut exp = Experiment::new();
/// exp.add_do_device("PXI1Slot6", 1e6);
/// exp.add_do_device("PXI1Slot7", 1e6);
/// exp.device_cfg_trig("PXI1Slot6", "PXI1_Trig0", true);
/// exp.device_cfg_trig("PXI1Slot7", "PXI1_Trig0", false);
/// ```
///
/// The compiler will panic if more than one device exports trigger
/// ```should_panic
/// # use nicompiler_backend::*;
/// let mut exp = Experiment::new();
/// exp.add_do_device("PXI1Slot6", 1e6);
/// exp.add_do_device("PXI1Slot7", 1e6);
/// exp.device_cfg_trig("PXI1Slot6", "PXI1_Trig0", true);
/// exp.device_cfg_trig("PXI1Slot7", "PXI1_Trig0", true);
/// ```
///
/// The compiler **will** panic if some device is expecting a start trigger yet no device exports one.
/// ```should_panic
/// # use nicompiler_backend::*;
/// let mut exp = Experiment::new();
/// exp.add_do_device("PXI1Slot6", 1e6);
/// exp.add_do_channel("PXI1Slot6", 0, 4, 0.);
/// exp.device_cfg_trig("PXI1Slot6", "PXI1_Trig0", false);
/// exp.go_high("PXI1Slot6", "port0/line4", 0.5);
/// exp.compile_with_stoptime(1.); // Panics here
/// ```
///
/// ## Phase-lock to Reference Clock
///
/// Relevant fields: `ref_clk_line`, `ref_clk_rate`, `export_ref_clk`.
///
/// Refer to the [NI documentation on phase-lock synchronization](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/ni-daqmx/page/mxcncpts/syncrefclock.html).
///
/// A subset of NI devices support this flexible synchronization method, which allows devices synchronized in this manner
/// to operate at different sampling rates. Devices phase-lock their on-board oscillators to an external reference at `ref_clk_line`
/// and indicate its frequency via `ref_clk_rate`. A device can optionally export its 10MHz onboard reference clock to `ref_clk_line` by setting `export_ref_clk` to `true`.
///
/// **Note**: Devices phase-locked in this manner still require start-trigger synchronization to ensure synchronized start times.
///
/// ### Example:
/// The device `PXI1Slot6` exports its start trigger signal to `PXI1_Trig0` and its 10MHz reference clock to `PXI1_Trig7`.
/// The device `PXI1Slot4` acts accordingly.
/// ```rust
/// use nicompiler_backend::*;
/// let mut exp = Experiment::new();
/// exp.add_ao_device("PXI1Slot3", 1e6);
/// exp.device_cfg_trig("PXI1Slot3", "PXI1_Trig0", true);
/// exp.device_cfg_ref_clk("PXI1Slot3", "PXI1_Trig7", 1e7, true);
///
/// exp.add_ao_device("PXI1Slot4", 1e6);
/// exp.device_cfg_trig("PXI1Slot4", "PXI1_Trig0", false);
/// exp.device_cfg_ref_clk("PXI1Slot4", "PXI1_Trig7", 1e7, false);
/// ```
///
/// ## Importing Sample Clock
///
/// Relevant fields: `samp_clk_src`.
///
/// Check out the [NI documentation on sample clock synchronization](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/ni-daqmx/page/mxcncpts/syncsampleclock.html).
///
/// Some NI devices do not support reference clock synchronization. As an alternative, they can directly use external
/// clock signals for their sampling clock. However, this constrains them to operate at the same rate as the imported sample clock.
///
/// ### Example:
/// Building on the previous example, an additional `PXI1Slot6` sources its sample clock from the 10MHz signal exported by `PXI1Slot3`.
/// ```rust
/// use nicompiler_backend::*;
/// let mut exp = Experiment::new();
/// exp.add_ao_device("PXI1Slot3", 1e6);
/// exp.device_cfg_trig("PXI1Slot3", "PXI1_Trig0", true);
/// exp.device_cfg_ref_clk("PXI1Slot3", "PXI1_Trig7", 1e7, true);
///
/// exp.add_ao_device("PXI1Slot4", 1e6);
/// exp.device_cfg_trig("PXI1Slot4", "PXI1_Trig0", false);
/// exp.device_cfg_ref_clk("PXI1Slot4", "PXI1_Trig7", 1e7, false);
///
/// exp.add_do_device("PXI1Slot6", 1e7);
/// exp.device_cfg_samp_clk_src("PXI1Slot6", "PXI1_Trig7");
/// exp.device_cfg_trig("PXI1Slot6", "PXI1_Trig0", false);
